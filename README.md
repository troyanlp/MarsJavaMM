Assumptions:
- There won't be negative numbers in the input, wether console or file.
- The lowerleft square position is (0,0) so when we say that the size of the grid is N,M we're really saying there are N+1 horizontal cells and M+1 vertical cells because we have to count the square 0 for each axis.
